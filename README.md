# Build Inside the Box Competition for element14 Presents

![Bald Engineer holding the Baldcorder](/images/baldengineer-with-baldcorder.jpg)

To celebrate element14 Presents' 500th build episode, they are challenged three of the video hosts to build a a project using 6 components.

I have to use all of these components, but can add others.
* Arduino MKR Zero
* Wago Pluggable Terminal Block
* Vishay Phototransistor
* Microchip Temperature Sensor
* Microchip MCP604-I/P
* Midas OLED Display
* ST-Micro Range/Gesture Sensor

The project I built is a "Baldcorder." A functional tricorder inspired by the models show on Star Trek: The Next Generation.

## Live stream list
James streamed most of the Baldcorder project on [Bald Engineer Live](https://twitch.tv/baldengineer). Well, 39 hours and 42 minutes of it. (Painting, lots of code, decal design, final assembly, and video editing were not streamed.) You can watch the build on these streams:
